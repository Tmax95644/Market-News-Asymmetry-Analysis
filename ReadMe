Do Markets Get More News Coverage on Big Down Days?
S&P 500 News Coverage Analysis (Python / MediaCloud)
Project Overview

This project examines whether large daily declines in the S&P 500 receive more media coverage than large daily gains, using:

MediaCloud daily news article counts

S&P 500 (^GSPC) daily price data from Yahoo Finance

The analysis tests a widely held assumption in financial commentary:

“Bad market days attract more news coverage than good market days.”

Research Question

Do large negative market moves generate more news coverage than similarly large positive moves?

Data Sources
1. Market Data

S&P 500 (^GSPC) daily prices

Source: Yahoo Finance (via yfinance)

Daily return defined as open-to-close percentage change

2. News Data

MediaCloud daily article counts

Query phrases:

“stock market”

“financial markets”

“equity markets”

“share market”

Raw MediaCloud data files are not included due to size and licensing constraints.

Tools & Libraries

Python

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

yfinance

Methodology
1. Data Preparation

Parsed and aligned dates across datasets

Cleaned MediaCloud output to retain daily article counts

Calculated daily S&P 500 returns:

2. Exploratory Analysis

Compared article counts on the 20 largest gain days and 20 largest loss days

Observed strong sensitivity to outliers, motivating a more robust comparison framework

3. Like-for-Like Threshold Analysis

To compare market moves of similar magnitude, days were classified using symmetric thresholds:

Large Loss: ≤ −3%

Large Gain: ≥ +3%

Key metrics:

Number of days

Mean article count

Median article count

The analysis was repeated using a ±2.5% threshold to increase sample size and test robustness.

4. Lag Analysis

To examine whether media attention peaks after large market declines, article volumes were analysed:

Same day

1 day after

2 days after

3 days after

Key Findings

Both large gains and large losses received substantially more coverage than normal trading days

Contrary to the initial hypothesis, large positive market moves often attracted equal or greater coverage than large negative moves

News coverage peaked on the same day as large losses and declined in subsequent days

Results were consistent across threshold definitions

Interpretation

These findings suggest that media coverage is driven more by market extremity and narrative significance than by negativity alone.

Large, unusual moves — regardless of direction — appear to attract attention.

Limitations

Small sample sizes for extreme market days

Article counts do not capture sentiment or tone

MediaCloud reflects curated sources rather than the full global news ecosystem

Daily aggregation obscures intraday timing effects

Follow-Up & Validation (SQL Project)

To validate that these findings were not specific to MediaCloud, the analysis was replicated using SQL and an independent dataset:

GDELT global news database

Analysis performed entirely in SQLite

Same market thresholds, classification logic, and aggregation methods

The SQL replication produced directionally consistent results, strengthening confidence in the conclusions.
